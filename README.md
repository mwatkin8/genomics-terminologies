_Title_:

Categorizing Genomic Concepts from Clinical and Research Terminologies Commonly Used in Cancer Reporting to Aid Semantic Linkage

_Abstract:_

Biomedical terminologies play a key role in the interoperability of clinical data. The Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) is a leader in cancer data harmonization. Each clinical domain has harmonization complexities, but genomics concepts are particularly difficult. The process depends on clinical genomics terminologies to provide structured data capture and interoperable concept definitions. Three terminologies in particular—NCIt, LOINC, and SNOMED—are widely used for reporting in both clinical and research settings. However, with a high level of pre-coordinated terms in each, their semantic compatibility is limited. In this study, we performed a preliminary classification of genomics concepts from these terminologies using 12 categories (drawn from the Sequence Ontology) and 8 contexts. This combination of category and context provides an insightful view into the terminologies and highlights several areas where conceptual clarity could be improved. This also constitutes a step toward the post-coordination of these terms and their increased semantic utility.
